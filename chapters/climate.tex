			\subsubsection{Climate change over geological cycles}
				We know climate change is partly a natural phenomenon because of the research done with Antarctic ice. Figure \ref{fig:1-antarctic-ice-records} clearly shows a natural cycle in temperatures over the last 800,000 years. Other evidence pointing to this conclusion can be found in landscapes which have been altered by moving glacial ice.
