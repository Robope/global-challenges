	\subsection{Study guide}
	
	The study guide for chapter 10 of the MOOC was a complete mess. That is why, even though this part of the summary is still based on the study guide, I won't be giving an overview of it in this summary.
	\\\\
	Typical questions are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Definitions, terminology: be able to explain the definition, give examples
		\item Graphs: be able to explain and interpret the graphs
		\item Principles: be able to explain, give examples
	\end{itemize}
