	\subsection{What is energy?}

	Energy is what causes change in the physical sense: for instance, you can do work or heat something up, or cause a chemical reaction. Energy is expressed in Joules [J]. When we want to explain how much energy is converted per time unit, we talk of power, expressed in Watt (Joules per second).In many practical applications the unit kWh is used: this is the amount of energy converted by an application with a power of 1 kW, if it would run for 1 hour. Energy vectors can be defined as the forms of energy, for example heat, electricity and chemical energy.
	\\\\
	In principle, energy cannot be destroyed nor created, it will always be converted in some other form. These conversions will not always be useful or desired. This is know as the first law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, some energy conversions can happen in the two directions: think of the battery in your mobile phone that can be charged and later discharged. Other conversions can only happen in one direction, for instance, you can burn a fuel to run a combustion engine in a car resulting in kinetic or motion energy, but you cannot recover the fuel as such when you slow down again. This follows from the second law of thermodynamics.
	\\\\
	Engineers usually talk about an energy system.This can be your home: you import energy like electricity or gas, to be converted into an energy service or end-use like lighting or heating. This is a simple example of an energy balance the amount of energy that is consumed equals the imported energy, of course plus some losses. When we zoom out, such energy balances can be drawn up for an entire country: typically, oil or gas, or perhaps coal is imported.
	
	\subsection{Thermic energy sources}
	
	Primary energy sources are found in nature in a stable form: for instance, oil, coal or sun light. Secondary sources do not occur in a stable natural form, but are created by conversion of a primary source. Electricity or hydrogen, so-called energy vectors, belong to this category. They might exist in nature – think of a lightning strike – but are not stable or concentrated enough to be usable.
	\\\\
	Some of these energy sources are renewable. Fossil fuels are not. These fossil fuels, typically in the form of coal, oil or gas, could lead to sustainability issues. Combusting them rises the CO2-levels in the atmosphere, thereby contributing to climate change. 
	\\\\
	The laws of thermodynamics will tell that each of these conversions will generated losses.As a consequence, the total efficiency is less than 40\%, meaning the majority of the primary energy is turned into useless heat rather than electricity. Gas power plants look pretty much the same. However, the modern ones are so-called “combined cycles”.
	
	They first use a compressor-combustion chamber-turbine combination which is similar to aircraft engines, but then with an electrical generator attached. The exhaust gases are hot enough to pass through a boiler after which electricity is generated with steam cycle.The combination of these two machine sets lifts the total efficiency up to 55 to 60\%. additional benefit is that these are much more dynamic and can change their output power rapidly.
	
	Such combined cycles are used in other applications as well, under the name combined-heat-and-power systems (CHP): for instance, many industrial processes in the food or chemical industry need a lot of high-temperature heat. By combine an electricity generation cycle with an exhaust temperature close to the process temperature, a very high total efficiency can be obtained.
	\\\\
	The traditionally used gas in these conversions is natural gas, containing fossil-based methane originating from gas fields. This methane can be extracted from rocky layers, but also from biological processes like fermentation, of for instance specifically grown plants or organic waste, coming from agriculture, food industry or other. Finally, gas can be made synthetically through a chemical process starting from hydrogen and a carbon source.
	
	\subsection{Renewable energy sources}
	
	It is possible to convert direct or scattered sun light directly into electricity using so-called photovoltaic, in short “PV”. Another form of weather-driven electricity production uses wind to drive large free-standing turbines with a build-in electricity generator. For completeness, we should also mention hydropower-based electricity production, which is in principle operating renewable and carbon-emission free as well. This kind of power plants use giant dams to withhold water on a river or a large difference in height in a mountainous region. By releasing the water through a turbine-generator combination, electricity is produced.
	
	\subsection{Energy cost}
	
	To make a fair comparison between the costs before and after the construction phase, the so-called “levelized cost of electricity” (LCOE) can be used.This allows to include all these costs over the whole lifetime of the installation on a common basis and average them over the produced unit of electrical energy. 
	\\\\
	In a system with many weather-related renewable sources like solar power, there is an obvious difference between the middle of the day, when there is abundant sun and the night. Because of the unbalances between production and consumption, the transition in between asks for a lot of alternative power sources to come on line. These can be batteries, other controlled power plants, or exchanges over the electricity grid with connected regions. This is depicted in the so-called “duck curve”. If we zoom out over a series of days, we have to account for cloudy days with for instance less wind. These are often referred to as “Dunkelflaute”, a German word. In practice also here the solution is a mix of generation technologies and international energy exchanges.
