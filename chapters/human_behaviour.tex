	\section{Human behaviour}
	
		\subsection{Study guide}
			A lot of the discussed global challenges and their solutions require a lot of change in behaviour from us humans. This however, is not easy. Because of this it's important to understand how the human brain works, what drives us and what motivates us. \\
			\\
			We will first explore the way in which we make decisions when faced with different dilemma's or situations. Once we know more about this, we can take a look at how to change these thoughts and convince people. Finally, we will take a look at how biasses affect our thinking.
